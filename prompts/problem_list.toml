title = "The Extreme Downhill Company"
description = """Michele Taggart oversees the manufacturing operations at the Extreme Downhill Company (EDC), which makes snowboards and skis. Michele needs to decide how many sets of skis and how many snowboards to make this week.

In the EDC factory, there is a molding machine, which is used to form skis and snowboards using plastic and metal. The molding machine takes three hours to make 100 pairs of skis, or it can make 100 snowboards in two hours.

The factory also has a cutting machine, which is used to sharpen the edges on the products, so they are ready to use. The cutting machine can process 100 pairs of skis in an hour, or it can do 100 snowboards in three hours.

Every snowboard and set of skis have to be loaded into the customized EDC delivery van as soon as it is finished in the factory, because there is no room in the factory to store any of the finished products. The van gets loaded up all week long and then Jason Brown, the driver, makes one trip on Saturday to make deliveries.

EDC makes $40 for every snowboard it sells, and $60 for every pair of skis. Michele wants to make sure she chooses the right mix of the two products so as to make the most money for her company, but she is limited by the following factors:

1. There are only two people who know how to operate the molding machine: Nick Conte and Dave Downing. Michele has it worked out with them so that Nick works in the daytime, and Dave works at night, so between them they keep the machine running most of the time. But even so, the molding machine is only running 115.5 hours every week, which limits the number of products EDC can make in a week.

2. The cutting machine is really on loan from the Brandon-Olofsson Company, and Michele only gets to use it 51 hours per week. This also limits the number of skis and snowboards she can make.

3. The van has a capacity of 48 cubic meters. 100 snowboards take up one cubic meter, and 100 sets of skis take up two cubic meters. Michele has no choice but to use Jason as the driver (it's his van) and so there isn't any point in making more products in a week than can fit into the van.

4. Finally, Michele knows from experience that snowboarding is a relatively new sport, and it is very hard for cool snowboarders to convince their fossilized parents to buy them the equipment they need. She has decided that she will never make more than 1,600 snowboards per week, because she won't be able to sell any more than that.

How many skis and snowboards should EDC manufacture this week?"""

title = "Assortment Recommendations"
description = """Many online platforms need to decide which products to show on the first page for a given keyword—for example, shoes. One critical aspect of this problem is that products are substitutable and hence capturing the consumers' substitution behavior is important. A widely used consumer choice model is the Multinomial logit (MNL) choice model due to the ground-breaking research by the Nobel Prize Winner in Economics Daniel McFadden in 2000. The basic idea is to represent each product i with a set of features Y_ik. For example, for shoes the features can include price, color, occasion, etc.

Customer j's utility is modeled as:
u_ij = a_i + sum_k b_k Y_ik + e_j,
where e_j is a random taste parameter that captures heterogeneous customer tastes (for the MNL choice model it is assumed that it follows a Gumbel distribution for tractability reasons). For simplicity, we can also write u_ij = v_i + e_j. The nice thing about this choice model is that it allows us to capture the choice probability of choosing a certain product i from an assortment of available products S.

In particular, given a set of products S, the probability that customer picks product i is given by:
P_i(S) = exp(v_i) / (1 + sum_{s in S} exp(v_s)) if product i is offered in the assortment S
P_i(S) = 0 if product i is not offered in assortment S

Moreover, denoting the no-purchase option by product i=0, the probability of no-purchase is given by:
P_0(S) = 1 / (1 + sum_{s in S} exp(v_s))

Now that we can capture the consumer choice model, a common question that many retailers face is how to optimally select the best assortment to maximize the expected profit given that different products have different contribution margins. An important trade-off that assortment managers should consider is that if they only show the most profitable item, customers may decide not to purchase anything; meanwhile if they show a wide assortment including products that are less profitable, there is a cannibalization effect since customers might substitute from highly profitable items to less profitable item."""

Delay Payments. In any month, the company's suppliers permit it to delay any or all payments for 1 month. However, for this consideration, the company forfeits a 2% discount that normally applies when payments are made on time. (Loss of this 2% discount is, in effect, a financing cost.)

Borrow Against Accounts Receivables. In any month, the company's bank will loan it up to 75% of the accounts receivable balances due that month. These loans must be repaid in the following month and incur an interest charge of 1.5%.

Short-Term Loan. At the beginning of January, the company's bank will also give it a 6-month loan to be repaid in a lump sum at the end of June. Interest on this loan is 1% per month and is payable at the end of each month.

Assume the company earns 0.5% interest each month on cash held at the beginning of the month.

What is the portfolio that will minimize the risk subject to achieving at least an 18% expected return?

Part (b): The data in the table above is typically obtained by taking samples of the returns of the stocks from a number of previous years and then calculating the averages, standard deviations, and covariance for these samples. Adjustments in the resulting estimate of at least the expected return of a stock also may be made if it appears that the current prospects for the stock are somewhat different than in previous years.

* Fixed operating costs are $30,000 a year. Variable operating costs each year could be as low as 55% of revenues or as high as 75%, with any values in between being equally likely. Costs in successive years are independent.

a) What is the probability that the project duration exceeds 16 weeks?

The cost of developing this project is equal to $3000. On the other hand, the revenue you can make out of this project depends on the time you (as project manager) promise to complete it. More specifically, you know that the revenues are given by:

Revenues = 30000 – 1000 × (Project duration (in weeks) that you quote)

However, if the duration of the project ends up being longer than the duration that you quote then there is a fixed penalty of $8000 that you will need to pay.

For example, if you quote a duration of 12 weeks and the project takes 12 or fewer weeks then your net profits are $18000 on revenues minus $3000 on fixed costs (that is, $15000). However, if the duration exceeds 12 weeks, then your profits are $18000 on revenues minus $3000 on fixed costs minus $8000 on penalty ($7000).

b) What is the optimal duration that you should quote?

c) Suppose you want to make sure the probability of having to pay a penalty is at most 10%. How would you add such a constraint?"""

Our company is contemplating the development and introduction of a new smart watch to the market. The company is mainly thinking about the following features for the watch:

1. Adding built-in GPS and Wi-Fi that operates independently (and not rely on a connecting device).
2. Making it modular, so that it consists of replaceable and interchangeable modules.
3. Adding a small built-in camera.
4. Adding a high-end battery, so that it lasts twice as long as the competing products.

Based on preliminary studies, the company has figured out that the profit for this watch will be determined by a random variable P via the following formula. All the figures are in million dollars.

P = P_baseline + P_GPS,Wi-Fi + P_modular + P_camera + P_battery

where:
P_baseline =
        N(200, 10)        with probability 0.4
        N(120, 15)        with probability 0.6

P_modular = N(35, 20)
P_camera = N(20, 5)
P_battery = N(15, 8)

However, there is a cost of investment (including the production cost and the R&D cost) for each of the above features: adding built-in GPS and Wi-Fi costs $30 million, making the phone modular costs $32 million, adding a camera costs $16 million, and including a high-end battery costs $10 million.
